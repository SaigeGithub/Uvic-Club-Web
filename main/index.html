<h1>UVIC Club App</h1>
<p class="name">  report by Saige Liu</p>
<p class="main">
The idea behind the app<br>As you can see,there are so many great clubs in our university,but it is kind of hard for students to find club imformation or when and where the club meet and the upcoming events. So we wanna to create a app that gather everything we can find about the clubs in Uvic,and allow students to check,even rate,like and add comments to the clubs.Also we wanna the organizers of the clubs to check the comments in order to improve their policy and updated their latest imformation.</p>
